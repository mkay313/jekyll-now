title: Accessibility Cheatsheet. How Jaws, NVDA and VoiceOver read site elements 
---

These days I've been diving deeper and deeper into Web accessibility which is an equally overwhelming and fascinating topic. Since I often use screen readers to assess the accessibility level of the elements I'm testing I wanted to see how the choice of the screen reader affects the end result. This may very well evolve into a few posts since there is **a lot** to cover.

__Disclaimer:__ What you're about to read is how a non-visually-impaired human perceives a given site by the means of a screen reader. Whatever errors there are, they stem from my ignorance. If you spot anything that's inaccurate, unsatisfactory, etc, let me know.
