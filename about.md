I'm a software tester / quality assurance gal, currently working at [Cognifide](http://cognifide.com).

My interests include, unsurprisingly, software testing, as well as data analysis in R and automating _all the things_ in Bash/Powershell.

I also co-organize [Rails Girls Poznan](http://www.railsgirls.com/poznan) and will gladly support any other diversity-oriented non-profits.

If you have an interesting book to recommend, the best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:mkmozgawa@gmail.com).

This page has been created using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now); its source code (and other silly projects of mine) are available [here](https://github.com/mkmozgawa).
