I'm a software tester / quality assurance gal, currently working at [Cognifide](http://cognifide.com).

Apart from testing, my interests include data analysis in R and bash scripting.

If you have an interesting book to recommend, the best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:mkmozgawa@gmail.com).
